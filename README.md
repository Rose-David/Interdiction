# Interdiction: The Game
If you're reading this, then ***how are you here?!?!?***

## List of Stuff that Needs To Get Done at Some Point
* Add Sprites for Hammerhead and the Player
* Sort through the Kenney SFX packs and find sound effects for:
	* Low Health Alarm (just needs minor editing)
	* Score Noise
	* Player/AI Thrusters
	* Collision Noises for everything
	* Hammerhead Charge Sound could use a change, but this will do for now
* Add script hooks to trigger sounds
* Add some collision VFX, at least for collisions with the wall.
	* Player boundary forces
	* Explosions?
		* This could maybe be the Deltarune/ULTRAKILL explosion FX for now (funni)
* Add Subsystem options
* Moar Dakka!
* Make an actual level and progression system

### *GET OUT!!!*
